## I = Simpson(x, y)
Simpson takes the numerical evaluation of an integral via Simpson's 1/3 Rule. It requires equally spaced intervals for inputs. 
If a input contains an even number of points, at least one iteration of the trapezoidal rule must be implemented (Proper warnings of this event will be given to the user) 

### Inputs
* x = the vector of equally spaced independent variable
* y = the vector of function values with respect to x
### Outputs:
* I = the numerical integral calculated
