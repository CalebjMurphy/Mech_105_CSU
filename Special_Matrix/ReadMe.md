## A = specialMatrix(n,m)
specialMatrix is a function that returns a n x m matrix with elements that have the following values:
* The value of each element in the first row is the number of the column.
* The value of each element in the first column is the number of the row.
* The rest of the elements each has a value equal to the sum of the element above it and element to the left.
* The function must return a sensible error if the user does not input exactly two arguments

### inputs
* n- number of rows wanted
* m- number of columns wanted

### outputs
* A- the matrix built with the given parameters

*Note:This was the first algorithm I developed in this class and doesn't carry any real applicable purpose*
